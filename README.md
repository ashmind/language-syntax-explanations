# Overview

This repository contains explanations for certain language syntax features (at the moment C# only).  
The explanations are presented in a way that is reasonably easy to parse and match to a syntax tree.

Currently only [SharpLab](https://sharplab.io) uses these, but please feel free to integrate into any IDE.
